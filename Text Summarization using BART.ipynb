The Jerdon's Babbler (chrysomma altirostre altirostre) - a small brown bird similar in size to a house sparrow - was last spotted in Myanmar in 1941 and was thought to have died out altogether. But a team of scientists managed to uncover multiple birds nesting in a small area of grassland in Myanmar's central Bago region in May last year, according to their report published in the latest edition of Birding Asia. Re-discovered:\\u00a0The Jerdon's Babbler which was thought extinct for 73 years until scientists found evidence of it living in Burma . The scientists targeted some of the few remaining patches of wild grassland left along Myanmar's mighty Irrawaddy river, now one of the most heavily cultivated and densely populated regions of the impoverished but emerging southeast Asian nation. At one small patch of grassland near an abandoned agricultural station, the team heard what they thought could be the babbler's call. They then used a recording of a Jerdon's Babbler from the Indian subcontinent to see if the bird would show itself. Frank Rheindt, from the National University of Singapore, told AFP he was the first person to spot the bird during the survey, which was also carried out with members of the Wildlife Conservation Society and Myanmar's Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division. 'It was unbelievable,' he recalled. 'We played the sound recordings and one of the birds came up from the reed beds. Like many song birds in reed beds you hardly ever see them, they only come out to defend their territory when they hear a territorial call.' Further searches over the next two days uncovered more birds allowing researchers to obtain blood samples and photographs. But researchers warned that the bird's survival is still far from guaranteed given pressure on Myanmar's few remaining grasslands. 'This discovery not only proves that the species still exists in Myanmar but that the habitat can still be found as well,' Colin Poole, director of Wildlife Conservation Society's regional hub in Singapore, said in a statement. 'Future work is needed to identify remaining pockets of natural grassland and develop systems for local communities to conserve and benefit from them,' he added. Birds fly over the Moe Yun Gyi Wetlands in Bago Division, Myanmar, where\\u00a0Jerdon's Babbler was re-discovered 73 years after it was believed to be extinct . Rheindt said the area of grassland where the bird was found was very small, 'around 50-80 hectares' and that new chicken and fish farms were being built nearby. He added that its plumage and song were significantly different to how it had been described by ornithologists in the early twentieth century - leading the team to suspect that it may differ from threatened populations found in Nepal, India and Pakistan. His team now hope to conduct DNA tests to decide if it is a separate species. Burma's quasi-civilian government replaced decades of brutal military rule in 2011. It has since embarked on a series of political reforms and shown itself to be far more open to foreign businesses and academic researchers than the country's generals were. Burma has more species of bird than any other country in mainland Southeast Asia, with ornithologists saying this number is could increase if more scientific research is conducted.\",\n          \"A Sydney pastor has spoken about the incredible moment Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan offered a vital piece of himself in a bid to save the man's life. Mal Feebrey, a men's mental health ambassador, had been diagnosed with terminal liver disease in 2010, when the death row inmate, with whom he had formed a close friendship, offered his own liver up for transplant. Chan, who had been in jail for five years at the time, 'knocked' the Assemblies of God minister about when he heard of his friends plight and immediately said, 'have mine'. Scroll down for video . Mal Feebrey (above left), a men's mental health ambassador, had been diagnosed with terminal liver disease in 2010, when Bali Nine kingpin Andrew Chan (above right), with whom he had formed a close friendship, offered his own liver up for transplant . 'It really touched me. Here I am waiting for a donor, I'm dying in front of my wife and kids and here he is going \\\"my liver's ok, you can have mine\\\",' Mr Feebrey told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'He was sort of like, if they want to kill me, then you can have my liver. It wasn't a passing-the-time comment, he wanted to make it happen. If he could have pulled it off he would have,' he said. Chan reportedly began making enquiries about whether the organ donation could go ahead, determined to save Mr Feebrey, who shared his Christian faith and had been a regular visitor since his incarceration in 2005. While Mr Feebrey received a liver from another organ donor, he said that the gesture was unforgettable and was characteristic of his 'incredible' friend. Chan and fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran are currently being held on Nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency. Mr Feebrey said that when Chan heard the news that his appeal for clemency from Indonesian President Joko Widodo, he was more concerned with the health of a fellow inmate who was in the jail's clinic than himself. 'It was a bit surreal. Andrew took it on the chin and with courage and then he just walked off to go to the clinic to go and see this guy,' Mr Feebrey said .

The pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two Australians . Chan and fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran are currently being held on Nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency . Mr Feebrey has continued to be in regular contact with Chan, and is an outspoken advocate for the 'I Stand For Mercy Campaign'. The pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two Australians, and posted on his Instagram account after the Chan heard of his rejected Clemency appeal. 'Just spent the last half an hour with my friend Andrew Chan, when the Australian Consulate Staff notified him that his final appeal against [the] death sentence was rejected,' Mr Feebrey posted. 'He took it on the chin with courage, humility and with a contrite heart.' In February, the pastor posted a 'message of hope' to supporters of Chan on his Instagram account. 'The most beautiful people that I've known are those that have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss and yet found a way out of these depths,' he posted underneath a photograph of himself with Chan. In February, the pastor posted a 'message of hope' to supporters of Chan on his Instagram account . The men's mental health ambassador said it would be tragic for Chan and Sukumaran, who have worked tirelessly to mentor other prisoners, to be executed. 'Andrew is the idyllic, dream guy to mentor and rehabilitate and a great seed like him \\u2013 they want to put to death?,' Mr Feebrey asked. Both Chan and Sukumaran have been involved in running education and drug rehabilitation programs inside Kerobokan prison since 2009. New footage has emerged of Sukumaran, shot as a part of a documentary in May last year, of Sukumaran discussing his hopes for the future before his bid for clemency was rejected. 'I think I can do a lot of good on the outside if I ever got free. It's not like I'm just going to go back after all this and just sit and be somewhere,' reported 9news. 'I would want to do stuff like work and make good stuff and help people,' he told Norwegian educator Ivar Schou, who met the Australian while running rehabilitation programs inside the prison. Sukumaran, who now faces the death penalty along with fellow inmate Andrew Chan, said that he believed he had done wrong but that he felt his punishment was too harsh. 'I accept what I did was wrong and I think I should be punished for it,' he said. The pair may be waiting months for their execution as other prisoners pursue lengthy appeals . Myuran Sukumaran, left, and Andrew Chan, right, will be put through an 'assimilation' process as they prepare to face the firing squad . 'But I do think the death penalty is too excessive.' Sukumaran was convicted in 2005 after attempting to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia. He has called Kerobokan prison in Bali his home for the past ten years, along with Chan. Sukumaran describes the immense change that he has seen in his life over the past ten years, most notably when he and other inmates were allowed to start education. 'In 2009 they finally gave us permission to start working and doing some projects. Slowly slowly it helped me with my life. It kept me busy. It helped me be productive. I started learning and I was able to help other people learning.' Earlier on Saturday the Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo said that the pair could have their executions delayed for months as other death row inmates take on lengthy court appeals. President Widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores . Mr Sukumaran was a highly respected art teacher while he was detained in Kerobokan prison . Mr Praseyto said the execution of the Bali nine duo will take place at the same time as several other foreigners on death row. This could delay the pair's execution as all avenues of legal appeal for the other eight convicted drug offenders must be exhausted before their death sentence can be carried out. The Australian government, alongside several notable public figures, have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has written to the Indonesia government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions. Ms Bishop is yet to receive a response.\",\n          \"Everton boss Roberto Martinez feels the poor condition of the pitch at Dynamo Kiev's Olympic Stadium is 'a concern' - but he is sure it will be just as problematic for one side as the other in Thursday's Europa League last-16 second-leg encounter.
